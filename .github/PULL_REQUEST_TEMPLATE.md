Before submitting your pull request be sure that:

1. You haven't touched any file in the `spyderlib/defaults` directory.
  - There is *absolutely* no need to touch those files.
  - If you want to add new configuration options, please go to
    `spyderlib/config/main.py`.
2. You haven't eliminated unnecessary blank lines or spaces during your work.
   That makes our reviewing work harder and it could introduce unnecessary
   conflicts with other pull requests.
3. You haven't added new icons to Spyder. Please leave decisions about what
   icons to use to us :)
