Spyder 3.0 has been a huge success (being downloaded more than 2.5 million times in
2018 alone!) and we hope 4.0 will be as successful. For that we fixed 502 bugs,
merged 741 pull requests from about 60 authors and added more than 5000 commits
between these two releases.

Hi all,

On the behalf of the Spyder Project Contributors (https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/graphs/contributors),
I'm pleased to announce that Spyder 3.0 has been released and is available for
Windows, GNU/Linux and MacOS X: https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/releases

Spyder is a free, open-source (MIT license) interactive development environment
for the Python language with advanced editing, interactive testing, debugging
and introspection features. It was designed to provide MATLAB-like features
(integrated help, interactive console, variable explorer with GUI-based editors
for NumPy arrays and Pandas dataframes), it is strongly oriented towards
scientific computing and software development.
