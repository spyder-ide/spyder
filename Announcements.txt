Major release to others
=======================

Subject: [ANN] Spyder 3.0 is released!


Hi all,

On the behalf of Spyder's development team (https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/blob/master/AUTHORS),
I'm pleased to announce that Spyder 2.3 has been released and is available for
Windows, GNU/Linux and MacOS X: https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/releases

Spyder is a free, open-source (MIT license) interactive development environment
for the Python language with advanced editing, interactive testing, debugging
and introspection features. It was designed to provide MATLAB-like features
(integrated help, interactive console, variable explorer with GUI-based editors
for NumPy arrays and Pandas dataframes), it is strongly oriented towards
scientific computing and software development.

This release represents 14 months of development since version 2.2 and introduces
major enhancements and new features:

   * Python 3 support (versions 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4 are supported).
   * Various Editor improvements:
     - Use the Tab key to do code completions
     - Highlight cells
     - First-class support for Enaml files
     - Improve how calltips are shown
   * Better looking Object Inspector
   * Several refinements to the user interface to make it easier and more intuitive
   * And many other changes: https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/blob/2.3/CHANGELOG.md

Spyder 2.2 has been a huge success (being downloaded more than 400,000 times!)
and we hope 2.3 will be as successful as it. For that we fixed 70 important bugs,
merged 30 pull requests from 11 authors and added almost 1000 commits between
these two releases.

Beta release
============

Subject: [ANN] Spyder 3.0 first public beta release


Hi all,

On the behalf of Spyder's development team (https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/graphs/contributors),
I'm pleased to announce the first beta of our next major version: Spyder 3.0.

We've been working on this version for about 10 months now and as far as we know
it's working very well. There are still several bugs to squash but we encourage all
people who like the bleeding edge to give it a try.

Perhaps the most important feature of this release is that it comes with support for
PyQt5. It also comes with several other important and interesting enhancements to our
graphical interface. For a complete list, please see here:

https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/wiki/Beta-version-changelog

This beta version is released a bit more than a month after our last stable release
(2.3.5.2) and it already contains several important bugfixes, specially regarding
viewing DataFrames in the Variable Explorer.

Enjoy!
-Carlos
