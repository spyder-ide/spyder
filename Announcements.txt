Spyder is a free, open-source (MIT license) interactive development environment
for the Python language with advanced editing, interactive testing, debugging
and introspection features. It was designed to provide MATLAB-like features
(integrated help, interactive console, variable explorer with GUI-based editors
for NumPy arrays and Pandas dataframes), it is strongly oriented towards scientific
computing and software development.

Major release to others
=======================

Subject: [ANN] Spyder 3.0 is released!


Hi all,

On the behalf of Spyder's development team (https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/blob/master/AUTHORS),
I'm pleased to announce that Spyder 2.3 has been released and is available for
Windows, GNU/Linux and MacOS X: https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/releases

Spyder is a free, open-source (MIT license) interactive development environment
for the Python language with advanced editing, interactive testing, debugging
and introspection features. It was designed to provide MATLAB-like features
(integrated help, interactive console, variable explorer with GUI-based editors
for NumPy arrays and Pandas dataframes), it is strongly oriented towards
scientific computing and software development.

This release represents 14 months of development since version 2.2 and introduces
major enhancements and new features:

   * Python 3 support (versions 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4 are supported).
   * Various Editor improvements:
     - Use the Tab key to do code completions
     - Highlight cells
     - First-class support for Enaml files
     - Improve how calltips are shown
   * Better looking Object Inspector
   * Several refinements to the user interface to make it easier and more intuitive
   * And many other changes: https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/blob/2.3/CHANGELOG.md

Spyder 2.2 has been a huge success (being downloaded more than 400,000 times!)
and we hope 2.3 will be as successful as it. For that we fixed 70 important bugs,
merged 30 pull requests from 11 authors and added almost 1000 commits between
these two releases.

Beta release
============

Subject: [ANN] Spyder 3.0 second public beta release


Hi all,

On the behalf of Spyder's development team (https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/graphs/contributors),
I'm pleased to announce the second beta of our next major version: Spyder 3.0.

We've been working on this version for more than a year now and as far as we know
it's working very well. There are still several bugs to squash but we encourage all
people who like the bleeding edge to give it a try. This second beta is released
four months after our first one and it includes more than 600 commits!

Spyder 3.0 comes with several interesting and exciting new features. The most
important ones are:

1. A file switcher very similar to the Sublime Text one (which can be activated
with `Ctrl+P`).
2. A new icon theme based on FontAwesome (not yet activated by default).
3. A new set of default pane layouts for those coming from Rstudio or Matlab
(under `View > Window layouts`).
4. Syntax highlighting for all file types supported by Pygments (a pure Python
highlighting library).
5. A simpler and more intuitive way to introduce keyboard shortcuts.
6. Support for PyQt5.

For a complete list of changes, please see here:

https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/wiki/Beta-version-changelog

You can easily install this beta if you use Anaconda by running:

    conda install -c spyder-ide spyder

Or you can download it from our Releases page: https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/releases
and previously installing QtAwesome with

    pip install qtawesome

Enjoy!
-Carlos
