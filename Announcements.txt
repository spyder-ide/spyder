computing and software development.

This release represents one month and a half of development since version 2.3.7
and introduces several new features:

* Python and IPython consoles
    * Fix a sitecustomize error when using Matplotlib 1.5 with Python 2 on Linux
* Variable Explorer
    * Add support for Pandas Series when using Pamdas 0.17+
    * Fix freeze when creating empty DataFrames in Python 2
    * Fix freeze when working with big Numpy recarray's

Major release to others
=======================

Subject: [ANN] Spyder 3.0 is released!


Hi all,

On the behalf of Spyder's development team (https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/blob/master/AUTHORS),
I'm pleased to announce that Spyder 2.3 has been released and is available for
Windows, GNU/Linux and MacOS X: https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/releases

Spyder is a free, open-source (MIT license) interactive development environment

and introspection features. It was designed to provide MATLAB-like features
(integrated help, interactive console, variable explorer with GUI-based editors
for NumPy arrays and Pandas dataframes), it is strongly oriented towards
scientific computing and software development.

This release represents 14 months of development since version 2.2 and introduces
major enhancements and new features:

   * Python 3 support (versions 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4 are supported).
   * Various Editor improvements:
     - Use the Tab key to do code completions
     - Highlight cells
     - First-class support for Enaml files
     - Improve how calltips are shown
   * Better looking Object Inspector
   * Several refinements to the user interface to make it easier and more intuitive
   * And many other changes: https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/blob/2.3/CHANGELOG.md

Spyder 2.2 has been a huge success (being downloaded more than 400,000 times!)
and we hope 2.3 will be as successful as it. For that we fixed 70 important bugs,
merged 30 pull requests from 11 authors and added almost 1000 commits between
these two releases.

Beta release
============

Subject: [ANN] Spyder 3.0 seventh public beta release


Hi all,

On the behalf of the Spyder Project Contributors (https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/graphs/contributors),
I'm pleased to announce the seventh beta of our next major version: Spyder 3.0.

We've been working on this version for more than two years now and as far as we know
it's working very well. There are still several bugs to squash but we encourage all
people who like the bleeding edge to give it a try. This beta version is released
two weeks after our sixth one and it includes more than 200 commits.

Spyder 3.0 comes with several interesting and exciting new features. The most
important ones are:

* Third-party plugins: External developers can now create plugins that extend Spyder in
  novel and interesting ways. For example, we already have plugins for the line-profiler
  and memory-profiler projects, and also a graphical frontend for the conda package
  manager. These plugins can be distributed as pip and/or conda packages for authors
  convenience.
* Improved projects support: Projects have been revamped and improved significantly in
  Spyder 3.0. With our new projects support, people will have the possibility of easily
  working on different coding efforts at the same time. That's because projects save the
  state of open files in the Editor and allow Python packages created as part of the
  project to be imported in our consoles.
* Support for much more programming languages: Spyder relies now on the excellent Pygments
  library to provide syntax highlight and suggest code completions in the Editor, for all
  programming languages supported by it.
* A new file switcher: Spyder 3.0 comes with a fancy file switcher, very similar in
  spirit to the one present in Sublime Text. This is a dialog to select among the open
  files in the Editor, by doing a fuzzy search through their names. It also lets users to
  view the list of classes, methods and functions defined in the current file, and select
  one of them. This dialog is activated with `Ctrl+P`.
* A Numpy array graphical builder: Users who need to create NumPy arrays in Spyder for
  matrices and vectors can do it now in a graphical way by pressing `Ctrl+M` in the Editor
  or the Consoles. This will open an empty 2D table widget to be filled with the data
  required by the user.
* A new icon theme based on FontAwesome.
* A new set of default pane layouts for those coming from Rstudio or Matlab (under
  `View > Window layouts`).
* A simpler and more intuitive way to introduce keyboard shortcuts.
* Support for PyQt5, which fixes problems in MacOS X and in high definition screens.

For a complete list of changes, please see here:

https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/wiki/Beta-version-changelog

You can easily install this beta if you use Anaconda by running:

    conda update qt pyqt
    conda install -c qttesting qt pyqt
    conda install -c spyder-ide spyder==3.0.0b7

Or you can use pip with this command:

    pip install --pre -U spyder


Enjoy!
