----

## Version 2.2.3

### Bug fixes

* [Issue 634](/spyder-ide/spyder/issues/634) - Debugging: Lingering break points
* [Issue 639](/spyder-ide/spyder/issues/639) - Project Explorer: horizontal size issue (added an optional horizontal scrollbar. This option may be enabled/disabled in the widget context menu)
* [Issue 749](/spyder-ide/spyder/issues/749) - Outline Explorer: Duplicate entries
* [Issue 852](/spyder-ide/spyder/issues/852) - Implement matlab-like cell features
* [Issue 1388](/spyder-ide/spyder/issues/1388) - Add an "About Spyder dependencies" dialog box
* [Issue 1438](/spyder-ide/spyder/issues/1438) - "runfile" doesn't work correctly if unicode_literals has been imported (replaced backslashes by slashes in paths)
* [Issue 1515](/spyder-ide/spyder/issues/1515) - Add an option to use the same interpreter Spyder is running on as "Python executable" for external consoles
* [Issue 1522](/spyder-ide/spyder/issues/1522) - licenses of the images (especially the .png)
* [Issue 1526](/spyder-ide/spyder/issues/1526) - Build script (setup.py) includes the wrong version of pyflakes/rope in Windows installer
* [Issue 1527](/spyder-ide/spyder/issues/1527) - please include the LICENSE file in the source package

### Other Changes

* New "Run selection" (F9), "Run cell" (Ctrl+Enter) and "Run cell and advance" (Shift+Enter) actions in "Run" menu entry, as a replacement to the old "Run selection or block" and "Run block and advance" actions.
* Added "Optional Dependencies" dialog box in "?" menu.
* Editor: added Monokai and Zenburn syntax coloring schemes.
* Keyboard shortcuts: removing deprecated shortcuts at startup. Otherwise, when renaming the name of a registered shortcut (in the code), the old shortcut will stay in Spyder configuration file and opening the Preferences dialog will show a shortcut conflict dialog box. In other words, shortcuts were added to configuration file when registered but never removed if they were removed from the registered shortcuts in the code (or if their context or name was renamed).
* External console tabs: fixed history browsing with Ctrl+Tab and added Shift+Ctrl+Tab support.
* Preferences>Console>Advanced: new option to switch between the default Python executable (i.e. the one used to run Spyder itself) and the custom Python executable that the user may choose freely. This change avoid side-effects when switching from a Python distribution to another on the same OS (with the same Spyder configuration file): many users do not change the Python executable and because of the way it was written in externalconsole.py, changing from a distribution of Python to another with the same Spyder config file could lead to an unexpected configuration (Spyder is executed with the new interpreter but scripts inside Spyder are executed with the old interpreter).
* Run Icons: removed deprecated images, updated other images to the new design
* setup.py/Windows installers: now building CHM documentation for Windows
* SPYDER_DEBUG environment variable now supports 3 levels of debug mode:
    * SPYDER_DEBUG=0 or False: debug mode is off
    * SPYDER_DEBUG=1 or True: debug level 1 is on (internal console is disconnected)
    * SPYDER_DEBUG=2: debug level 2 is on (+ logging coms with external Python processes)
    * SPYDER_DEBUG=3: debug level 3 is on (+ enabling -v option in external Python processes and debugging editor)

## Version 2.1.13.1

### Bug fixes

* Spyder startup: fixed PyQt minimum version requirement test (the old poor comparison algorithm was considering that v4.10 was older than v4.4...) (See [Issue 1291](/spyder-ide/spyder/issues/1291))
* Console: Matplotlib was always imported even when the Matplotlib's Patch option was not available (i.e. the Matplotlib installed version was not compatible with the patch). As a consequence, even when disabling every console advanced option in preferences, the preloaded module list was huge
* Editor:
    * When closing Spyder with unsaved modified files, Spyder was asking confirmation as many times as there were editor windows. Only one confirmation is necessary because, with current editor design, all editor windows are synced.
    * When creating two new files, saving one of them will lead to temporarily mask the leading '`*`' indicating the fact that the other untitled file was not already saved. This is simply a display issue: internally, it is clear that the file is in a non-saved state and Spyder will ask for it to be saved when trying to close the file
    * Multiple windows: when saving a new untitled file, other editor windows were getting confused on file list order -- eventually leading to data loss
    * Open file dialog: default file type filter now matches the current file (See [Issue 1201](/spyder-ide/spyder/issues/1201))
* Fixed "PyQt Reference Guide" link

* Editor: Ctrl+MouseWheel is now zooming in/out the editor text size (see [Issue 1270](/spyder-ide/spyder/issues/1270))
* About dialog box: changed the "This project is part of Python(x,y)" part to more general words (which are also closer to the initial meaning of this sentence) including a citation of WinPython


----


## Version 2.1.13

### Bug fixes

* Fixed [Issue 1158](/spyder-ide/spyder/issues/1158): "pip install spyder" fails on non-Windows platforms due to a bug in pip installation process (missing spyderlib_win_postinstall.py script)
* File Explorer/Windows/Fixed "remove tree" feature: added an error handler in shutil.rmtree to be able to remove a non-empty folder with shutil.rmtree is not working on Windows when it contains read-only files
* (See [Issue 1106](/spyder-ide/spyder/issues/1106)) Fixed "error: unpack requires a string argument of length 8" related to socket communication between Spyder and the remote Python process
* Editor:
    * After splitting horizontally or vertically the editor window, filenames were not synchronized when saving a file as another name (see [Issue 1120](/spyder-ide/spyder/issues/1120))
    * Fixed error when trying to "Save as..." a file with extension to a file without any extension (see [Issue 1183](/spyder-ide/spyder/issues/1183))
    * pep8 code analysis: a new line character was abusively added by Spyder to source code before analyzing it because it's necessary for pyflakes but it's not for pep8! (see [Issue 1123](/spyder-ide/spyder/issues/1123))
    * Fixed UnboundLocalError when clicking on "Search/Replace" button if both search pattern and replace pattern fields are empty (see [Issue 1188](/spyder-ide/spyder/issues/1188))
* Pylint plugin/tree widget: "go to line" was not working when filename contained additionnal dots (see [Issue 1179](/spyder-ide/spyder/issues/1179))
* Fixed critical bug when an invalid/unsupported version of pyflakes is installed (see [Issue 1181](/spyder-ide/spyder/issues/1181))
* Editor/block comments: fixed remaining PyQt API v2 compatibility issues (see [Issue 905](/spyder-ide/spyder/issues/905))
* Variable explorer: more flexible name fixing algorithm (even if it's not a good practice to use reference names with upper case letters, we do not remove them anymore) -- See [Issue 1169](/spyder-ide/spyder/issues/1169)

### Other changes

* Spyder about dialog box: added Python build architecture (32 or 64 bits)
* Find in files: fixed default 'exclude pattern' which was accidently excluding all files starting with 'build' instead of simply excluding 'build' folders as intended
* For the sake of consistency, now using single-clicks for activating entries of all tree widgets in Spyder ("Find in files" and "Pylint" are now consistent with the "Outline" explorer) -- See [Issue 1180](/spyder-ide/spyder/issues/1180)


----


## Version 2.1.12

### Bug fixes

* Spyder settings: sometimes (virus protection?) the .ini file can't be written, and removing the .ini file before writing seems to help, as suggested [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/spyderlib/a_P9JBJEZeE/gOK_Pr2WbE8J) (see [Issue 1086](/spyder-ide/spyder/issues/1086))
* Fixed Home/End key behaviour inconsistency on MacOS X (See [Issue 495](/spyder-ide/spyder/issues/495))
* Internal console: new option "Pop up internal console when errors were intercepted" -- default: False, which avoids loosing focus when a traceback is shown in the internal console... but features may also fail silently! (bugs could stay hidden a while before being taken care of) -- See [Issue 1016](/spyder-ide/spyder/issues/1016)
* Fixed "TypeError: file_saved(long,long).emit(): argument 1 has unexpected type 'long'" error occuring on some Linux 32-bit platforms -- See [Issue 1094](/spyder-ide/spyder/issues/1094)
* Console: find/replace widget "Search next/previous occurence" feature was broken

### Other changes

* Portable version of Spyder (inside WinPython):
    * Spyder '?' menu: added documentation detection (.chm, .pdf) in sys.prefix\Doc (Windows-only)
    * Project explorer:
        * Handling errors when opening a workspace which has been moved
        * Workspace is now configured with relative paths, so it can be moved from a location to another and still be opened in Spyder
* Windows: moved the functions hiding parent console to spyderlib/utils/windows.py


----


### Version 2.1.11

### Bug fixes

* Critical bugs:
    * Editor ([Issue 960](/spyder-ide/spyder/issues/960)): cannot open/save files from GUI (QFileDialog issue with PyQt4 v4.6)
* General:
    * Spyder menu bar: fixed menu ordering issue with Ubuntu/Unity
    * All console widgets: Shell widget: fixed "Clear terminal" (Ctrl+L) shortcut
* Console:
    * Cleaned up widget interactions after Python script execution (before this changeset, it was possible to send data to console, which not only was not needed but was generating disturbing errors in the internal console...)
* Editor:
    * If user accept to fix "mixed end-of-line characters", when opening file, the current editor was set as "modified" (the tab title had a `*` at the end) instead of the newly created editor
    * "occurrence highlighting" was highlighting previous word even if there was a whitespace between cursor and this word
    * Code analysis thread manager: handling errors while executing threads
    * "Replace all" was not regrouping changes into a single undo/redo step
    * "Find/Replace": replacements were not done for case unsensitive searches
    * Position of the 79-chars edge line is now more accurate on Linux, the older processed position was inaccurate with some font size of the classic "DejaVu Sans Mono" monospace font
* IPython:
    * Version detection was broken so Preferences...Console...External Modules was incorreclty hiding the command line options line edit
    * Because the detection was not working correctly, it was not possible to start an IPython kernel with the just released IPython 0.13
* Project explorer was sometimes producing AttributeError when loading because of the workspace was not defined at the beginning of the class constructor
* pyflakes code analysis function:
    * Handling files with invalid \x or null chars
    * This fixes a part of [Issue 1016](/spyder-ide/spyder/issues/1016) by handling the following pyflakes bugs:
      * http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=674796
      * http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=674797

### Other changes

* Installer for Windows (bdist_wininst/bdist_msi):
    * added Start Menu shortcuts
    * added 'pyflakes' and 'rope' (if available in the repository) to the package list (this is not conventional but Spyder really need those tools and there is not decent package manager on Windows platforms, so...)
    * This change will make the Spyder building process simpler for Windows as the Python(x,y) won't be needed anymore to provide Start Menu shortcuts or to install 'rope' and 'pyflakes' at the same time. Now, there is no significative difference between the standard installers built with distutils (bdist_wininst or bdist_msi options) and the Python(x,y) plugin, except for the "package upgrade" ability (uninstall previous version) which is still not (and won't be) supported by distutils.


----


## Version 2.1.10

### Bug fixes

* Critical bugs:
    * Spyder crashed at startup/TypeError: `_isdir()` takes exactly 1 argument (0 given). Affects only Windows platforms with Python 3.2.2+ or 2.7.3+)
    * Spyder was freezing when working with netCDF4 objects in the interactive console
    * Console: h5py was systematically imported to avoid crashes with the HDF5 plugin (Variable Explorer's I/O plugin). These ugly workarounds introduced with revision 3affc82ce081 were removed in this changeset to avoid side effects like DLL version conflict on Windows platforms. The main risk of this change is to break the HDF5 plugin on some configurations. But this is the best compromise.
* General:
    * Fixed regression: when no Qt library is installed (PyQt/PySide), warning the user with a Tkinter dialog box (if possible)
    * Fixed Preferences Dialog flickering issue introduced with revision a4e1565e93c5
    * Run configuration dialog: fixed Tab focus order behavior
    * Fixed "Run > Configure..." and "PYTHONPATH management" entry locations on MacOSX
    * Updated bootstrap script and Qt library selection logic to accomodate launch of Spyder using PySide while PyQt is also installed ([Issue 1013](/spyder-ide/spyder/issues/1013), see [Issue 975](/spyder-ide/spyder/issues/975) for additional background).
    * Fixed several encoding problems preventing Spyder from launching when the user's home directory contains non-ASCII characters ([Issue 812](/spyder-ide/spyder/issues/812), [Issue 1027](/spyder-ide/spyder/issues/2017)).
    * Debugging: [Issue 684](/spyder-ide/spyder/issues/684): Debug with winpdb will now use the command line options and working directory specified in the General Setting section of the Run Configuration dialog
* Console:
    * Changed "Clear shell" shortcut to "Ctrl+L" to avoid conflict with the Windows Task Manager shortcut on Windows platforms
    * Preferences/Advanced options: added option to start an IPython kernel at startup
* Editor:
    * When multiple files were open, close-clicking 1 file was closing 2 files on 64-bits OS
    * Conditional breakpoint could not be changed to regular breakpoint
    * Outline Explorer: removed obsolete decorated methods icon (a decorated method is now shown exactly as a regular method)
    * Top-left corner menu (file list): fixed common prefix removal feature
    * "Outline" item selection opened in incorrect split panel due to a lost signal when focus changed from an editor to another
    * when splitting window after changing a shortcut, old shortcut was still active
* Internal console/fixed an old regression: re-added help(), raw_input() support
* Profiler: tree was sometimes empty + fixed error when file path contained "&"
* File/Project explorer: fixed [by shchelokovskyy] Git commit/browse support
* Find in files: fixed crash due to a bug in the common prefix finder function

### Other changes

* Checked Spyder's `rope` patch compatibility with rope v0.9.4
* IPython plugin (experimental):
    * added support for "Execute in current interpreter"
    * added support for "Execute selection or block (F9)"
    * imports from local directory did not work
    * when a new kernel is started in Console, tabifying the frontend to the Console (for the first created frontend) and the next frontends to the previously created frontend
    * clients (frontends) may now really be closed (see context menu). The associated kernel and related clients may be closed as well (a message box dialog ask the user about this)
    * added support for the "Object Inspector to/from IPython kernel" link
    * improved reliability of the "Editor to/from IPython kernel" link
    * fixed focus management issue (link with variable explorer and object inspector)


----


## Version 2.1.9

### Bug fixes

* Run configuration/bugfix: command line options were not properly parsed
* Preferences dialog was not showing up with PySide installed *and* without PyQt4
* Editor:
    * Closing additional editor window produced traceback and primary editor breakdown
    * File/Open: embedded editor popped up even if there is one in a separate window
    * Selecting a part of a word raises an IndexError exception
    * Revert option was prompting for user input even on an unmodified buffer
    * Added missing .f77 file extensions for Fortran files filter
    * Occurence highlighting was not working when cursor was at the left side of a word and if the next character was ':', ',' or '(' (or any other character not matching the "word regexp")
* Console:
    * Console was unusable (endless tracebacks) when monitor was disabled
    * File drag'n drop was not working (should execute dropped file)
* (Experimental) IPython plugin:
    * Fixed compatibility issues with PyQt4 and IPython 0.12
    * Fixed multiple instances issue (it was not possible to open more than one IPython frontend) and other issues
    * IPython kernel connections were unpredictable ([Issue 977](/spyder-ide/spyder/issues/977))
* Dictionary editor (Variable explorer): fixed UnboundLocalError when context menu is called on an empty table
* Object inspector failed to show an error message due to unicode error
* Project Explorer:
    * "Show all files" option was broken after restarting Spyder
    * It was impossible to create a project from an existing directory located outside the workspace


----


## Version 2.1.8

### Bug fixes

* Editor/Source code toolbar:
    * "Show task list" and "Go to the next task" actions: the "Show TODO/FIXME/XXX/HINT/TIP comments list" button was not working
    * "Show warning/error list" and "Go to the next warning/error" actions: the "Show code analysis warnings/errors" button was not working


----


## Version 2.1.7

### Bug fixes

* Main window:
    * Detached dockwidgets were not painted after restarting Spyder ([Issue 880](/spyder-ide/spyder/issues/880))
* Console:
    * Enhanced Python interpreter: %clear command was broken since v2.1.5
* Object inspector's rich text mode: fixed unexpected indent error
* IPython plugin: fixed compatibility issue with latest v0.12dev (thanks to Boris Gorelik)

### Other changes

* Variable explorer/Array editor: added support for masked arrays
* Showing Spyder's internal console automatically when there is a traceback
* Do not crash when a 3rd party plugin failed to import
* Editor:
    * Automatic insertion of single, double and triple quotes
    * Automatically colons insertion when pressing Enter after 'if', 'def', etc
    * Don't trigger code completion on comments if text ends with a dot
    * Added keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+Escape) to clear the console
    * Added keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+P) to print current file (thanks to fheday at gmail dot com for the contribution)
    * Code introspection features (code completion, calltips, go-to-definition) are now working even if script has syntax errors


----


## Version 2.1.6

### Bug fixes

* Critical bug on certain Windows platforms (not sure yet if it's related to a particular version of PyQt or something else): all plugins (dockwidgets) were shown detached (or hidden) from the mainwindow at startup (this is related to the attempt fixing [Issue 880](/spyder-ide/spyder/issues/880))


----


## Version 2.1.5

### Bug fixes

* Detached dockwidgets (Console, ...) were not painted after restarting Spyder
* Editor/Outline-bugfix: duplicate entries were shown when the editor was synchronizing file contents with disk
* File/Project explorer:
    * Fixed regression regarding [Issue 740](/spyder-ide/spyder/issues/740) (fixed in v2.1.0, re-introduced in v2.1.2): couldn't open files with non-ascii characters in their names
    * SCM support: commit/log actions were not working when right-clicking on a file instead of a folder
* Console:
    * Monitor/Introspection: fixed socket communication issue due to a MemoryError -- This error was mixing communication messages, causing various problems described in [Issue 857](/spyder-ide/spyder/issues/847) and [Issue 858](/spyder-ide/spyder/issues/858). This bug was reported by ruoyu0088, who also tried (and succeeded) to fix it and suggested a workaround which is implemented in this release
    * Fix critical console hang on OS X when using the "Run selection or current block feature" (see [Issue 502](/spyder-ide/spyder/issues/502))
    * Apply the right scheme color to the IPython console when there weren't any options provided by the user or when the only option was "-colors LightBG"
* Windows platforms:
    * "Preferences" dialog was not shown if account username contained non-ASCII characters
* Object Inspector:
    * Show signatures for docstrings sent from the Editor (see [Issue 690](/spyder-ide/spyder/issues/690))

### Other changes

* Debugging: when a non-empty SPYDER_DEBUG environment variable exists, Spyder switch to debug mode (log files are created in user's home directory and debug prints are available in the terminal)
* Variable explorer/Dictionary editor: added option to plot histogram from a 1-D array
* Console:
    * standard Python interpreter is now a real Python interactive session: the older implementation was running a startup script and tried to emulate a standard Python interactive session (changing attributes like __name__, running the PYTHONSTARTUP script, etc.). But this implementation was not close enough to the standard Python interactive session, i.e. when you execute `python` outside Spyder, without any argument. A recent bug report confirmed this: the PYTHONSTARTUP script was executed but not exactly the same way as it is outside Spyder: for example, doing `from __future__ import division` in the startup script had no effect whereas it did outside Spyder.
    * when running a standard Python interpreter, instead of running the startup script (spyderlib/widgets/externalshell/startup.py), the shell widget (ExternalPythonShell) simply runs the python executable with -u -i options, that's all. So now, the PYTHONSTARTUP script is executed as expected.
    * Scientific startup script (default PYTHONSTARTUP in Spyder): added floating point division (from __future__ import division)
    * PySide support:
        * Added new "Qt (PyQt/PySide)" settings group in "External modules" tab
        * It is now possible to select the Qt-Python bindings library: default (i.e. depends on the QT_API environment variable), PyQt or PySide
        * The PyQt input hook has been adapted for PySide, so it is now possible to do interactive (non-blocking) plotting with PySide
    * New options for standard Python interpreters (no effect on IPython):
        * "Merge process standard output/error channels": merging the output channels of the process means that the standard error won't be written in red anymore, but this has the effect of speeding up display
        * "Colorize standard error channel using ANSI escape codes": this method is the only way to have colorized standard error channel when the output channels have been merged
* Internal console ([Issue 868](/spyder-ide/spyder/issues/868)): output is now immediately available
* "Maximize current plugin" action: now automatically shows the "Outline" plugin when maximizing the "Editor" plugin
* Editor/Outline comment separators: allow space betwee hash and dash, e.g "# --- Outline Separator"


----


## Version 2.1.4

### Bug fixes

* Console:
    * *Critical bugfix* for IPython support: variable explorer link was broken (regression introduced with v2.1.3)

### Other changes

* Console:
    * option "Open an IPython interperter at startup" is now *explicitely* disabled for IPython v0.11+ (these versions of IPython are not fully supported through Spyder's console plugin)


----


## Version 2.1.3

### Enhancements

* Variable explorer performance were improved, especially when dealing with very long sequences -- See [this discussion](http://groups.google.com/group/spyderlib/browse_thread/thread/3a7ef892695e417a)
* Variable explorer / dictionary editor: added support for unknown objects -- this allows browsing any object attributes -- This is still experimental.

### Bug fixes

* General:
    * Spyder preferences/bugfix: comboboxes with keys other than strings (e.g. the PyQt API selection combo box) were not initialized properly
    * Fixed memory leaks (QThread objects) in the "Editor" and "Find in files" plugins. In those two plugins, QThread objects were created, then started but were never garbage-collected after they finished their execution
* Editor:
    * Supported file types: added missing C++ file extensions (.cc, .hh, .hxx)
* Variable explorer:
    * Debugging: added support for editing objects within functions
    * Debugging: when debugging, variable explorer link was broken after restarting program
    * handling errors when trying to enable/disable autorefresh (if one of the running console has no monitor enabled)
* Project explorer:
    * when the workspace has not yet been defined, creating a new project not only warns the user but also proposes to set it right away


----


## Version 2.1.2

### Bug fixes

* General:
    * Patched external path library to avoid a crash with a user HOME directory with non-ascii characters
    * Doc/README: warning the user about the fact that the 'python setup.py install' method does not uninstall a previous version
* Console:
    * Fixed "AccessInit: hash collision: 3 for both 1 and 1" error (see [Issue 595](/spyder-ide/spyder/issues/595))
* Project explorer:
    * empty workspace/critical bugfix: impossible to create/import projects from context menu (this bug was introduced with a recent revision and stayed unnoticed until then because one has to test this from an empty workspace)
    * it is now possible to rename projects (safely)
    * now handling the I/O errors (e.g. read-only configuration files) occuring when loading/saving projects or the workspace: warning the user when an IOError exception was raised and mention the projects which could not be saved properly
* File/Project explorer:
    * keyboard shortcut 'F2' (rename file/directory) was broken
    * the "Open" action (context menu) was failing silently for directories (expected behavior: open an external file explorer to browse the directory)
    * programs.start_file/bugfix: feature was not working on Windows 7
* Editor:
    * Fix empty username in new file template on OS X (patch by Christoph Gohle)
* Object inspector:
    * Rich text mode was not showing headings when invoked from editor ([Issue 690](/spyder-ide/spyder/issues/690))

### Enhancements

* File/Project explorer:
    * Added "Delete" keyboard shortcut to remove selected file(s)/folder(s)
    * SCM integration: added support for TortoiseHg v2 (only v1 was supported)
* Console/Matplotlib options: the backend may now be set separately from the Matplotlib patch

### Other changes

* Console:
    * The Matplotlib patch is only applied for Matplotlib <=v1.0
    * PyQt API version issues (error like "ValueError: API 'QString' has already been set to version 1"): the "ignore setapi errors" option is disabled by default, to avoid masking these errors and associated tracebacks


----


## Version 2.1.1

_Note:_ v2.1.1 is a minor update of v2.1.0 (licence issues and minor bug fixes)

Follow Spyder news on our official blog:
http://spyder-ide.blogspot.com/

### Compatibility/Requirements

Since version 2.1:
* Spyder is now compatible with:
    * PyQt's API v1 (i.e. compatible with PyQt 4.4 and 4.5), the default Python 2 API
    * *and* PyQt's API v2 (this is the future: default Python 3 API and PySide-compatible API)
    * *and* with PySide (PySide support is still experimental as this library is still young but its stability is evolving rapidly)
* Editor/code analysis: Spyder now requires *pyflakes v0.5.0* (included in Windows installers).

### New features since v2.0.12

* New *Profiler* plugin (thanks to Santiago Jaramillo)
* New experimental *IPython* plugin embedding IPython's Qt console: see [here](http://spyder-ide.blogspot.com/2011/08/preview-of-new-ipython-plugin-for.html)
* General:
    * Main window:
        * added "Custom window layouts" management (see menu "View")/handling 3 custom layouts: default shortcuts Shift+Alt+FX to switch to/from layout #X and Ctrl+Shift+Alt+FX to set layout #X
        * "General" preferences page: added option to set the Qt windows style, depending on platform (Plastique, Cleanlooks, CDE, Windows...)
        * Menu "?": added menu entry to report Spyder issues, filling automatically informations on your configuration
        * Reorganized "Run"/"Source" menu, added "Interpreters" menu
        * Fixed application name for Gnome 3/Fedora 15
* Command line options: added option "--defaults" to reset settings (stored in .spyder.ini) to defaults (a lot of settings are preserved: shortcuts, window layouts, ...) -- this is less brutal than "--reset" which reset all settings by removing all configuration files related to Spyder
* *Outline* (function/class browser) is now a plugin in itself, embedded in its own dockwidget: Spyder's window layout is even more customizable than before
* *Code completion*
    * (Editor/Console): entries starting with an underscore character are now placed to the end of the suggested list
    * (Editor/Console): Import statements are now completed correctly
* *Console*:
    * Major code cleaning: running Python applications in Spyder has never been cleaner and is very close to a simple Python interpreter
    * Added built-in function `open_in_spyder` to open a file in Spyder's source code editor from the console
    * Standard Python interpreter:
        * now refresh the variable explorer at each new prompt (even if auto-refresh is disabled -- actually, this is the typical use case)
        * added support for basic special commands (%pwd, %ls, %clear) and system commands (starting with '!', e.g. !dir or !ls)
        * added ["scientific" startup script](http://spyder-ide.blogspot.com/2011/09/new-enhanced-scientific-python.html) with support for numpy, scipy and matplotlib
    * Preferences (External modules tab):
        * added an option to set PyQt API to v1 or v2 -- this avoids issues with Enthought Tool Suite or any other library/program using PyQt API v2 which is *not* the default API for Python 2
        * changed matplotlib patch to fix compatiblity issue with PyQt API v2
    * Preferences (Advanced Settings tab): added option "Python executable" to customize path to Python interpreter executable binary
* *Variable explorer*:
    * New HDF5 plugin by [DavidAnthonyPowell](http://code.google.com/u/DavidAnthonyPowell/): import/export HDF5 files to/from the variable explorer
    * Dictionary editor/Variable explorer:
        * Added support for more NumPy data types
        * Added action "Resize rows to contents" (partially implements feature requested with [Issue 807](/spyder-ide/spyder/issues/807))
* *Editor*:
    * find/replace:
        * added support for *multiline* regular expression search pattern
        * added support for *multiline* regular expression text replacement
        * added button "Highlight matches" to highlight all found results
    * syntax highlighting: added support for OpenCL, gettext files, patch/diff files, CSS and HTML files
    * support for "2 spaces" and "tabs" indentation characters
    * new code analysis feature: added support for the [pep8](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pep8) style guide checker
    * "Comment" and "Uncomment" actions were replaced by a single "Comment/Uncommment" toggle action
    * (Fixes  [Issue 811](/spyder-ide/spyder/issues/811) ) "Run configuration": added "Run in an external system terminal" option
* *File explorer* and *Project explorer*:
    * great performance improvement (using a multithreaded file system model)
    * Added minimalist SCM support (Mercurial and git are currently supported)
* *File explorer*: added an option to "Show current directory only"
* *Project explorer*: this plugin was entirely rewritten to improve performances and usability
* *Pylint plugin*:
    * added option to save file before analyzing it
* Spyder's console embedded in your application (spyderlib.widgets.internalshell):
    * in traceback, a clickable link now opens the associated file in Spyder (if application was launched from Spyder with monitor enabled)
    * Application sample embedding Spyder's internal shell: upgraded to guidata v1.4+ (simplified build script a lot)
* Windows platforms specific changes:
    * (requires pywin32) Hiding the attached console window:
        * allow running Spyder with 'python.exe' without visible console (this avoid using 'pythonw.exe' which does not attach a console to the process, hence preventing standard I/O to be redirected in a subprocess executed within Spyder, e.g. in your own program)
        * the attached console may be shown/hidden from menu entry "View > Attached console window (debugging)"
* Major change for Windows/PyQt users: standard Python interpreter now supports interactive GUI manipulations thanks to a new Spyder-specific input hook (replacing PyQt's input hook which is not working within Spyder on Windows platforms) -- the input hook works even better than PyQt's builtin input hook (with a Python interpreter opened outside Spyder)
* Spyder's stand-alone version building process was improved. This version is now available on project's download page.

### Bug fixes (since v2.0.12)

* Spyder's main window:
    * QtDesigner and QtLinguist were not detected on Fedora
    * Console/Editor: code completion widget was partially hidden when working on two monitors and if Spyder's window was on the right screen
    * Fixed bugs due to too early/frequent calls to plugin refresh methods during startup
* Console:
    * IPython Interpreter: Turn off autoindent magic to avoid indentation errors with code with inline comments
* Editor:
    * Fortran syntax highlighter was made case insensitive
    * Fixed IndentationError when running first line of a file
    * Read only files allowed ".", "[", "(", etc. to be entered into the text editor
    * Fixed segmentation faults occuring after using the vertical-horizontal splitting feature
    * If a file name had non-ascii characters then code completion (and all other rope-based features) in the editor stopped working
    * Code analysis: fixed tasks pattern (for example, previous one was matching "TIP" in "MULTIPLICATION"... now it will match only single "TIP:" or "TIP ")
    * (Fixes  [Issue 704](/spyder-ide/spyder/issues/704)) Outline was showing the delimiters of block comments ('#------...-'), causing nesting inconsistencies because block comments are not indented properly with respect to the code around
    * Fixed several bugs with the "Run selection or current block" feature.
* Object inspector:
    * Rich text mode was failing for non-ascii docstrings
* Find/Replace widget:
    * Combo box history was populated only when pressing Enter (now pressing F3 to find next occurence will add the current entry to history)

* Preferences Dialog (dialog box + keyboard shortcut page): improved size/resize behavior
* Editor: when cursor was on the very last line, Duplicate/Delete line features were getting stuck in an infinite loop
* Editor/duplicate line feature - fixed unexpected behavior: when duplicating selected text, text selection was extended to duplicated part
* Editor/bugfix with multiple editor windows: when opening file on one editor window, the top-left corner menu (file list) was not updated correctly in other editor windows
* Editor/fixed unexpected behavior: when clicking on the main window's outline explorer while a separate editor window had focus, the latter was used to show the associated line of code
* Project explorer: added new debugging options (profiling 'rope' calls)

* Editor/Tab bar: fixed missing tooltips issue (and missing file switch menu entries)
* Code completion/bugfix: list widget was not hiding as expected when pressing ':'
* Editor/fixed unexpected behavior: when some text was selected, "Ctrl+Left mouse click" was trying to "go to definition" instead of doing the standard drag n'drop feature
* Editor/bugfix: disabling code completion/calltips for non-Python source code (was not working -as expected- but was taking time to simply not work...)
* Editor/go to line: fixed unicode error
* Code editor/bugfix: cursor position was not restored when undoing an indent operation with "tab always indent" feature turned on *and* the cursor at the end of the line
* Tab behavior when "tab always indents" is turned off: inserting 4-(len(leading_text) % 4) spaces (instead of 4)
* Object inspector/bugfix: ignoring unknown objects when called automatically from editor/console, i.e. do not log, do not show 'no doc available'

### Other changes (since v2.0.6)

----


## Version 2.0.6

### Bug fixes

* Console: menu entries "Environment variables", "Current working directory" and "Show sys.path" were not disabled when the Monitor was turned off
* Preferences dialog box/Keyboard shortcuts:
    * conflicts are now ignored if shortcuts have different contexts *except* if one of this context is '`_`' (i.e. global context)
    * conflict warnings are now also shown when showing the preferences dialog box (not only when modifying shortcuts and applying changes)
* Drag/drop Python script to console: fixed TypeError (TypeError: start() got an unexpected keyword argument 'ask_for_arguments')
* Console base widget: added support for FF (Form Feed) ANSI sequence - Fixes bug in IPython console: 'cls' and 'clear' magic commands were inactive in IPython consoles
* Editor: code completion was sometimes very slow when editing files within a Spyder project
* Code editor: fixed "Delete line" feature (Ctrl+D) / was not working with multiline selection

### Other changes

* Editor/80-column vertical edge line: added options to show/hide this line and change the column number
* Editor: added "Comment"/"Uncomment" actions to context menu
* Source code and shell editor widgets: code refactoring/cleaning (this should help people using these widgets outside Spyder)
