I’m pleased to announce that Spyder 2.3.4 has been released and is available for
Windows, GNU/Linux and MacOS X: https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/releases

introduces several new features:

* Debugging
    * After pressing the Debug button (or `Ctrl+F5`) move to the first breakpoint
* IPython Console
    * Drop support for Sympy versions less than 0.7.3
* Python Console
    * Remove support to run system commands with ! (like !diff)

    * Accept drops from compressed files on Windows

We also fixed almost 30 bugs and merged 6 pull requests. For a full list of fixes
see our changelog: https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md

This is going to be the last release in 2.3 series. Very soon we are going to
release the first beta of our next major release (expected to be ready on July!)

and introspection features. It was designed to provide MATLAB-like features
(integrated help, interactive console, variable explorer with GUI-based editors
for NumPy arrays and Pandas dataframes), it is strongly oriented towards scientific
computing and software development.

Major release to others
=======================

Hi all,

On the behalf of Spyder's development team (https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/blob/master/AUTHORS),
I'm pleased to announce that Spyder 2.3 has been released and is available for
Windows, GNU/Linux and MacOS X: https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/releases

Spyder is a free, open-source (MIT license) interactive development environment
for the Python language with advanced editing, interactive testing, debugging
and introspection features. It was designed to provide MATLAB-like features
(integrated help, interactive console, variable explorer with GUI-based editors
for NumPy arrays and Pandas dataframes), it is strongly oriented towards
scientific computing and software development.

This release represents 14 months of development since version 2.2 and introduces
major enhancements and new features:

   * Python 3 support (versions 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4 are supported).
   * Various Editor improvements:
     - Use the Tab key to do code completions
     - Highlight cells
     - First-class support for Enaml files
     - Improve how calltips are shown
   * Better looking Object Inspector
   * Several refinements to the user interface to make it easier and more intuitive
   * And many other changes: https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md

Spyder 2.2 has been a huge success (being downloaded more than 400,000 times!)
and we hope 2.3 will be as successful as it. For that we fixed 70 important bugs,
merged 30 pull requests from 11 authors and added almost 1000 commits between
these two releases.

Don't forget to follow Spyder updates/news:
  
* on the project website: https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder
* and on our official blog: http://spyder-ide.blogspot.com/

Last, but not least, we welcome any contribution that helps making Spyder an
efficient scientific development/computing environment. Join us to help creating
your favorite environment!

Enjoy!
