Spyder v2.3.0 -- 07/11/2013
===========================

Hi all,

On the behalf of Spyder's development team (https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/blob/master/AUTHORS), I'm pleased to announce that Spyder 2.3 has been released and is available for Windows, GNU/Linux and MacOS X: https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/releases

Spyder is a free, open-source (MIT license) interactive development environment for the Python language with advanced editing, interactive testing, debugging and introspection features. It was designed to provide MATLAB-like features (integrated help, interactive console, variable explorer with GUI-based editors for NumPy arrays and Pandas dataframes), it is strongly oriented towards scientific computing and software development.

This release represents 14 months of development since version 2.2 and introduces major enhancements and new features:

   * Python 3 support (versions 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4 are supported).
   * Various Editor improvements:
     - Use the Tab key to do code completions
     - Highlight cells
     - First-class support for Enaml files
     - Improve how calltips are shown
   * Better looking Object Inspector
   * Several refinements to the user interface to make it easier and more intuitive
   * And many other changes: https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/wiki/Changelog

Spyder 2.2 has been a huge success (being downloaded more than 400,000 times!) and we hope 2.3 will be as successful as it. For that we fixed 70 important bugs, merged 30 pull requests from 11 authors and added almost 1000 commits between these two releases.

Don't forget to follow Spyder updates/news:
  * on the project website: https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder
  * and on our official blog: http://spyder-ide.blogspot.com/

Last, but not least, we welcome any contribution that helps making Spyder an efficient scientific development/computing environment. Join us to help creating your favorite environment!

Enjoy!
