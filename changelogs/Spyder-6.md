# History of changes for Spyder 6

## Version 6.1.0 (Unreleased)

### New features

* Add a graphical interface to the update process of our standalone installers.
* Plot histograms from the dataframe viewer.
* Add support for Polars dataframes, frozen sets, Numpy string arrays and `pathlib.Path` objects to the Variable Explorer.
* Show the remote file system in the Files pane when a remote console has focus.
* Add support to connect to JupyterHub servers.
* Add support to use Pixi environments in the IPython console.
* Paths can be added to the front of `sys.path` in the Pythonpath manager.
* Copy/cut the current line if nothing is selected in the Editor with `Ctrl+C`/`Ctrl+X`, respectively.
* Add option to show/hide the Editor's file name toolbar to `Preferences > Editor > Interface`.
* Select full floating point numbers by double-clicking them on the Editor and the IPython console.

### Important fixes

* Much better support for PyQt6 and PySide6.
* Make shortcuts to move to different panes work when they are undocked.
* Remove blank lines around cells when copying their contents to the console.
* Automatically kill kernels when Spyder crashes.
* Disable magics and commands to call Python package managers in the IPython console because they don't work reliably there.
* Drop support for Python 3.8

### UX/UI improvements

* Reorganize most menus to make them easier to navigate.
* Add shortcut `Ctrl+W` to close Variable Explorer viewers.
* Add option to hide all messages displayed in panes that are empty to `Preferences > Application > Interface`.
* Fix plots looking blurred when scaling is enabled in high DPI screens.

### API changes

#### Editor

* **Breaking** - The `NewFile`, `OpenFile`, `OpenLastClosed`, `MaxRecentFiles`, `ClearRecentFiles`, `SaveFile`, `SaveAll`, `SaveAs`, `SaveCopyAs`, `RevertFile`, `CloseFile` and `CloseAll` actions were moved to the `ApplicationActions` class in the `Application` plugin.
* **Breaking** - The shortcuts "new file", "open file", "open last closed", "save file", "save all", "save as", "close file 1", "close file 2" and "close all" were moved to the "main" section.
* Add `open_last_closed`, `current_file_is_temporary`, `save_all`, `save_as`, `save_copy_as` and `revert_file` methods.
* Add `set_default_kernel_spec` to `remoteclient` plugin, in order to set default kernel spec used to open default consoles.

#### IPython console

* **Breaking** - The `sig_current_directory_changed` signal now emits two strings instead of a single one.
* **Breaking** - Remove `set_working_directory` method. You can use `set_current_client_working_directory` instead, which does the same.
* **Breaking** - The `save_working_directory` method was made private because it's only used internally.
* Add `sender_plugin` kwarg to the `set_current_client_working_directory` method.
* Add `server_id` kwarg to the `set_current_client_working_directory` method.

#### Working Directory

* **Breaking** - The `sig_current_directory_changed` signal now emits three strings instead of a single one.
* **Breaking** - The `sender_plugin` kwarg of the `chdir` method now expects a string instead of a `SpyderPluginV2` object.
* Add `server_id` kwarg to the `chdir` method.


#### Remote Client

* **Breaking** - The `create_ipyclient_for_server` and `get_kernels` methods were removed.
* Add `sig_server_changed` signal to report when a server was added or removed.
* Add `get_server_name` method to get a server name given its id.
* Add `register_api` and `get_api` methods in order to get and register new rest API modules for the remote client.
* Add `get_jupyter_api` method to get the Jupyter API to interact with a remote Jupyter server.
* Add `get_file_api` method to get the rest API module to manage remote file systems.
* Add `get_environ_api` method to get the rest API module to work with environment variables in the remote machine.

#### Pythonpath manager

* **Breaking** - The `sig_pythonpath_changed` signal now emits a list of strings and a bool, instead of two dictionaries.

#### Application plugin

* Add `create_new_file`, `open_file_using_dialog`, `open_file_in_plugin`, `open_last_closed_file`, `add_recent_file`, `save_file`, `save_file_as`, `save_copy_as`, `revert_file`, `close_file`, `close_all` and `enable_file_action` methods to perform file operations in the appropriate plugin.
* Add `focused_plugin` attribute.

#### File Explorer

* **Breaking** - `ExplorerTreeWidgetActions` renamed to `ExplorerWidgetActions`.
* **Breaking** - The `sig_dir_opened` signal now emits two strings instead of a single one.
* Add `server_id` kwarg to the `chdir` method.

### Main menu

* **Breaking** - From `SourceMenuSections`, move the `Formatting` section to `EditMenuSections` and `Cursor` to `SearchMenuSections`, remove the `CodeAnalysis` section and add the `Autofix` section.
* **Breaking** - Replace the `Tools`, `External` and `Extras` sections in `ToolsMenuSections` with `Managers` and `Preferences`.

#### SpyderPluginV2

* Add `CAN_HANDLE_FILE_ACTIONS` and `FILE_EXTENSIONS` attributes and `create_new_file`, `open_file`, `get_current_filename`, `current_file_is_temporary`, `open_last_closed_file`, `save_file`, `save_all`, `save_file_as`, `save_copy_as`, `revert_file`, `close_file` and `close all` methods to allow other plugins to hook into file actions.
* Add `sig_focused_plugin_changed` signal to signal that the plugin with focus has changed.

#### PluginMainWidget

* Add `SHOW_MESSAGE_WHEN_EMPTY`, `MESSAGE_WHEN_EMPTY`, `IMAGE_WHEN_EMPTY`, `DESCRIPTION_WHEN_EMPTY` and `SET_LAYOUT_WHEN_EMPTY` class attributes,
  and `set_content_widget`, `show_content_widget` and `show_empty_message` methods to display a message when it's empty (like the one shown in
  the Variable Explorer).

#### Shellconnect

* **Breaking** - Rename `is_current_widget_empty` to `is_current_widget_error_message` in `ShellConnectMainWidget`.
* Add `switch_empty_message` to `ShellConnectMainWidget` to switch between the empty message widget and the one with content.
* Add `ShellConnectWidgetForStackMixin` class for widgets that will be added to the stacked widget part of `ShellConnectMainWidget`.

#### AsyncDispatcher

* **Breaking** - Remove `dispatch` method to use it directly as decorator.
* Add class `DispatcherFuture` to `spyder.api.asyncdispatcher` and `QtSlot` method to `AsyncDispatcher` so that connected methods can be run inside the main Qt event loop.
* Add `early_return` and `return_awaitable` kwargs its constructor.

## Version 6.0.0 (2024-09-03)

### New features

* New installers for Windows, Linux and macOS based on Conda and Conda-forge.
  They come up with a more robust update process and are based on Python 3.11.
* Add a Debugger pane to explore the stack frame of the current debugging
  session.
* Add a button to the Debugger pane to pause the current code execution and
  enter the debugger afterwards.
* Add submenu to the `Consoles` menu to start a new console for a specific
  Conda or Pyenv environment.
* Add ability to refresh the open Variable Explorer viewers to reflect the current
  variable value.
* Add initial support to automatically connect to remote servers through SSH
  and run code in them. This functionality can be found in the menu
  `Consoles > New console in remote server`.
* Show plots generated in the Variable Explorer or its viewers in the Plots pane.
* Show Matplotlib backend and Python environment information in the status bar.
* Make kernel restarts be much faster for the current interpreter.
* Add experimental support for Qt 6 and increase minimal required version to
  Qt 5.15.
* Turn `runfile`, `debugfile`, `runcell` and related commands into IPython magics.

### Important fixes

* Environment variables declared in `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zhrc` are detected and
  passed to the IPython console.
* Support all real number dtypes in the dataframe viewer.
* Respect Matplotlib user settings configured outside Spyder.
* Increase DPI of Matplotlib plots so they look better in high resolution screens.
* Allow to copy the absolute and relative paths of the current file to the tabs'
  context menu of the Editor.
* Restore ability to load Hdf5 and Dicom files through the Variable Explorer
  (this was working in Spyder 4 and before).
* Add ability to disable external plugins in `Preferences > Plugins`.
* Use a simpler filesystem watcher in Projects to improve performance.

### UX/UI improvements

* Make Spyder accept Chinese, Korean or Japanese input on Linux by adding
  `fcitx-qt5` as a new dependency (in conda environments only).
* The file switcher can browse and open files present in the current project
  (in conda environments or if the `fzf` package is installed).
* Improve how options are displayed and handled in several Variable Explorer
  viewers.
* The interface font used by the entire application can be configured in
  `Preferences > Appearance`.
* Files can be opened in the editor by pasting their path in the Working
  Directory toolbar.
* Add a new button to the Variable Explorer to indicate when variables are being
  filtered.
* Show intro message for panes that don't display content at startup.

### New, updated and removed plugins

* Add a Switcher plugin for the files and symbols switcher.
* Add a Debugger plugin to centralize all functionality related to debugging.
* Add an External Terminal plugin to execute Python and Bash/Batch/PS1 files on
  a system terminal.
* Generalize the Run plugin to support generic inputs and executors. This allows
  plugins to declare what kind of inputs (i.e. file, cell or selection) they
  can execute and how they will display the result.
* Declare a proper API for the Projects plugin.
* The Editor now uses the API introduced in Spyder 5. That was the last built-in
  plugin that needed to be migrated to it.
* The Breakpoints plugin was removed and its functionality moved to the Debugger
  one.

### New API features

* `SpyderPluginV2.get_description` must be a static method and
  `SpyderPluginV2.get_icon` a class or static method. This is necessary to
  display the list of available plugins in Preferences in a more user-friendly
  way (see PR [PR 21101](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/pull/21101) for
  the details).
* `SpyderPlugin` and `SpyderPluginWidget` are no longer exposed in the public
  API. They will be removed in Spyder 6.1.
* All comboboxes must inherit from `SpyderComboBox` or related subclasses in
  `spyder.api.widgets.comboboxes`. Comboboxes that inherit directly from
  `QComboBox` won't follow Spyder's graphical style.
* All menus must inherit from `SpyderMenu` in `spyder.api.widgets.menus`.
* All dialog button boxes must inherit from `SpyderDialogButtonBox` in
  `spyder.api.widgets.dialogs`.
* Helper classes were added to `spyder.api.fonts` to get and set the fonts used
  in Spyder in different widgets.
* Helper classes were added to `spyder.api.shortcuts` to get and set keyboard
  shortcuts.
* `AsyncDispatcher` was added to `spyder.api.asyncdispatcher` to run asyncio
  code in Spyder. Only Qt signals can be attached to asyncio
  `future.add_done_callback` calls to avoid segfaults.
* `ShellConnectStatusBarWidget` was added to `spyder.api.shellconnect.status`
  to create status bar widgets connected to the current console.
