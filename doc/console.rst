Console
=======

The **Console** is where you may enter, interact with and visualize data, 
inside a command interpreter. All the commands entered in the console are 
executed in a separate process, thus allowing the user to interrupt any 
process at any time.

Many command windows may be created in the **Console**:

* Python interpreter
* Running Python script
* System command window (this terminal emulation window has quite limited 
  features compared to a real terminal: it may be useful on Windows 
  platforms where the system terminal is not much more powerful - on the 
  contrary, on GNU/Linux, a real system terminal is opened, outside Spyder)

Python-based command windows support the following features:

* Code completion and calltips
* Variable explorer with GUI-based editors for arrays, lists, 
  dictionaries, strings, etc.
* Debugging with standard Python debugger (`pdb`): at each breakpoint 
  the corresponding script is opened in the :doc:`editor` at the breakpoint 
  line number
* User Module Deleter (see below)

Reloading modules: the User Module Deleter (UMD)
------------------------------------------------

When working with Python scripts interactively, one must keep in mind that 
Python import a module from its source code (on disk) only when parsing the
first corresponding import statement. During this first import, the byte code 
is generated (.pyc file) if necessary and the imported module code object is 
cached in `sys.modules`. Then, when re-importing the same module, this cached 
code object will be directly used even if the source code file (.py[w] file) 
has changed meanwhile.

This behavior is sometimes unexpected when working with the Python interpreter 
in interactive mode, because one must either always restart the interpreter 
or remove manually the .pyc files to be sure that changes made in imported 
modules were taken into account.

The User Module Deleter (UMD) is a Spyder console's exclusive feature that 
forces the Python interpreter to reload modules completely when executing 
a Python script.

For example, when UMD is turned on, one may test complex applications 
within the same Python interpreter without having to restart it every time 
(restart time may be relatively long when testing GUI-based applications).
