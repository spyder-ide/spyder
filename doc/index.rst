Spyder - Documentation
======================

Spyder is the Scientific PYthon Development EnviRonment:

* a powerful interactive development environment for the Python language with 
  advanced editing, interactive testing, debugging and introspection features
  
* and a numerical computing environment thanks to the support of `IPython` 
  (enhanced interactive Python interpreter) and popular Python libraries 
  such as `NumPy` (linear algebra), `SciPy` (signal and image processing) 
  or `matplotlib` (interactive 2D/3D plotting).

Spyder may also be used as a library providing powerful console-related widgets 
for your PyQt-based applications -- for example, it may be used to integrate a 
debugging console directly in the layout of your graphical user interface.
