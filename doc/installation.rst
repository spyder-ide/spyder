Installation
============

Spyder is quite easy to install on Windows, Linux and macOS. Just the read the
following instructions with care.

Installing on Windows Vista/7/8/10
----------------------------------

The easy way
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Spyder is already included in these *Python Scientific Distributions*:

* `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/download/>`_
* `WinPython <https://winpython.github.io/>`_
* `Python(x,y) <https://code.google.com/p/pythonxy>`_

You can start using it immediately after installing one of them (you only need
to install one!).


The hard way
~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to install Spyder directly, you need to follow these steps:

#. Install the essential requirements:

   * `The Python programming language <http://www.python.org/>`_
   * `PyQt5 <http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/download5>`_ (recommended)
     or `PyQt4 <http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/download>`_

#. Install Spyder and its dependencies by running this command::

       pip install spyder


Updating Spyder
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can update Spyder by:

* Updating Anaconda, WinPython or Python(x,y).

* Or using this command (in case you *don't* use any of those scientific
  distributions)::

        pip install --upgrade spyder

  .. note::

     This command will also update all Spyder dependencies

|

Installing on macOS
-------------------

The easy way
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Thanks to the Spyder team and `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/>`_, Spyder is included
in the `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/download/>`_ Python distribution,
which comes with everything you need to get started in an all-in-one package.


The hard way
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Thanks to the *MacPorts* project, Spyder can be installed using its ``port`` package manager.
There are `several versions`__ available from which you can choose from.

__ http://www.macports.org/ports.php?by=name&substr=spyder

  .. warning::

     It is known that the MacPorts version of Spyder is raising this error:
     ``ValueError: unknown locale: UTF-8``, which doesn't let it start correctly.
   
     To fix it you will have to set these environment variables in your
     ``~/.profile`` (or ``~/.bashrc``) manually::
        
        export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
        export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8

   ``pip install --upgrade spyder``


Run without installing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can execute Spyder without installing it first by following these steps:

#. Unzip the source package
#. Change current directory to the unzipped directory
#. Run Spyder with the command ``python bootstrap.py``
#. (*Optional*) Build the documentation with ``python setup.py build_doc``.

This is especially useful for beta-testing, troubleshooting and development 
of Spyder itself.
