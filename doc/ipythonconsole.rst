IPython Console
===============

Spyder's **IPython Console** implements a full two-process 
`IPython <http://ipython.org/>`_ session where
a lightweight front-end interface connects to a full IPython kernel on the
back end. Visit the IPython project website for full documentation of 
IPython's many features.

From the Interpreters menu, Spyder can launch **IPython Console**
instances that attach to kernels that are managed
by Spyder itself or it can connect to external kernels that are managed
by IPython Qt Console sessions or the IPython Notebook.

When "Connect to an existing kernel" is selected, Spyder prompts for the 
kernel connection file details:

**IPython Consoles** that are attached to kernels that were created by
Spyder support the following features:

* Code completion
* Variable explorer with GUI-based editors for arrays, lists, 
  dictionaries, strings, etc.
* Debugging with standard Python debugger (`pdb`): at each breakpoint 
  the corresponding script is opened in the :doc:`editor` at the breakpoint 
  line number
* User Module Deleter (see :doc:`console` for more details)

**IPython Consoles** attached to external kernels support a smaller feature
set:

* Code completion
* Debugging toolbar integration for launching the debugger and sending
  debugging step commands to the kernel. Breakpoints must be set manaully
  from the console command line.
