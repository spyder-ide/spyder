# Major release to list

**Subject**: [ANN] Spyder 5.0 is released!


Hi all,

On the behalf of the [Spyder Project Contributors](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/graphs/contributors),
I'm pleased to announce that Spyder **5.0** has been released and is available for
Windows, GNU/Linux and MacOS X: https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/releases

This release represents more than one year of development since version 4.0 was
released, and it introduces major enhancements and new features. The most important ones
are:

* Improved dark theme based on QDarkstyle 3.0.
* New light theme based on QDarkstyle 3.0.
* New look and feel for toolbars.
* New icon set based on Material Design.
* New API to extend core plugins, with the exception of the Editor, IPython
  console and Projects.
* New plugins to manage menus, toolbars, layouts, shortcuts, preferences and
  status bar.
* New architecture to access and write configuration options.
* New API to declare code completion providers.
* New registries to access actions, tool buttons, toolbars and menus by their
  identifiers.

For a complete list of changes, please see our
[changelog](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/blob/5.x/CHANGELOG.md)

Spyder 4.0 has been a huge success and we hope 5.0 will be as successful. For that we
fixed 54 bugs, merged 142 pull requests from about 16 authors and added more than
830 commits between these two releases.

Don't forget to follow Spyder updates/news on the project's
[website](https://www.spyder-ide.org).

Last, but not least, we welcome any contribution that helps making Spyder an
efficient scientific development/computing environment. Join us to help creating
your favorite environment!

Enjoy!

**Subject**: [ANN] Spyder 4.0 is released!


Hi all,

On the behalf of the Spyder Project Contributors (https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/graphs/contributors),
I'm pleased to announce that Spyder 3.0 has been released and is available for
Windows, GNU/Linux and MacOS X: https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/releases

Spyder is a free, open-source (MIT license) interactive development environment
for the Python language with advanced editing, interactive testing, debugging
and introspection features. It was designed to provide MATLAB-like features
(integrated help, interactive console, variable explorer with GUI-based editors
for NumPy arrays and Pandas dataframes), it is strongly oriented towards
scientific computing and software development.

# Alpha/beta/rc release

**Subject**: [ANN] Spyder 6.0 beta1 is released!


Hi all,

On the behalf of the [Spyder Project Contributors](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/graphs/contributors),
I'm pleased to announce the first beta of our next major version: Spyder **6.0**.

We've been working on this version for more than one year now and it's working
relatively well. There are still several bugs to squash but we encourage all
people who like the bleeding edge to give it a try. This beta version includes
more than 201 commits over our latest alpha release (6.0.0a5).

Spyder 6.0 comes with the following interesting new features and fixes:

- New features
    * New installers for Windows, Linux and macOS based on Conda and Conda-forge.
    * Add a Debugger pane to explore the stack frame of the current debugging
      session.
    * Add a button to the Debugger pane to pause the current code execution and
      enter the debugger afterwards.
    * Add submenu to the `Consoles` menu to start a new console for a specific
      Conda or Pyenv environment.
    * Add ability to refresh the open Variable Explorer viewers to reflect the current
      variable state.
    * Show plots generated in the Variable Explorer or its viewers in the Plots pane.
    * Show Matplotlib backend state in status bar.
    * Make kernel restarts be much faster for the current interpreter.
    * Turn `runfile`, `debugfile`, `runcell` and related commands into IPython magics.

- Important fixes
    * Environment variables declared in `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zhrc` are detected and
      passed to the IPython console.
    * Support all real number dtypes in the dataframe viewer.
    * Restore ability to load Hdf5 and Dicom files through the Variable Explorer
      (this was working in Spyder 4 and before).

- New API features
    * `SpyderPluginV2.get_description` must be a static method now and
      `SpyderPluginV2.get_icon` a class or static method. This is necessary to
      display the list of available plugins in Preferences in a more user-friendly
      way (see PR spyder-ide/spyder#21101).
    * Generalize the Run plugin to support generic inputs and executors. This allows
      plugins to declare what kind of inputs (i.e. file, cell or selection) they
      can execute and how they will display the result.
    * Add a new plugin called Switcher for the files and symbols switcher.
    * Declare a proper API for the Projects plugin.
    * Remove the Breakpoints plugin and add its functionality to the Debugger one.

For a more complete list of changes, please see our
[changelog](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder/blob/master/changelogs/Spyder-6.md)

You can easily install this beta if you use conda by running:

    conda install -c conda-forge/label/spyder_dev -c conda-forge/label/spyder_kernels_rc -c conda-forge spyder=6.0.0b1

Or you can use pip with this command:

    pip install --pre -U spyder


Enjoy!
Daniel
