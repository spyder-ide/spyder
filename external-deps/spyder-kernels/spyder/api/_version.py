Spyder API Version.

The API version should be modified according to the following rules:

1. If a module/class/method/function is added, then the minor version
   must be increased.

2. If a module/class/method/function is removed, renamed or changes its
   signature, then the major version must be increased.

3. Whenever possible, deprecation marks and alerts should be employed in
   order to inform developers of breaking-compatibility changes in a
   future API release. In such case, the minor version should be increased
   and once the deprecated APIs disappear then the major version should be
   updated.
