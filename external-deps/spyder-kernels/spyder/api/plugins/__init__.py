spyder.api.plugins
==================

Here, 'plugins' are Qt objects that can make changes to Spyder's main window
and call other plugins directly.

There are two types of plugins available:

1. SpyderPluginV2 is a plugin that does not create a new dock/pane on Spyder's
   main window. Note: SpyderPluginV2 will be renamed to SpyderPlugin once the
   migration to the new API is finished

2. SpyderDockablePlugin is a plugin that does create a new dock/pane on
   Spyder's main window.
