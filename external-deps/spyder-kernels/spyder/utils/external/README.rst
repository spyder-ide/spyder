IMPORTANT NOTES:
################

See __init__.py in this directory for general information about its contents.

See LICENSE.txt in this directory or NOTICE.txt in the Spyder root
for more information on each file and project added here.

Make certain to keep all file headers intact if originally present!


When adding a file:
===================

Make sure the file is not under a "copyleft" license like the GPL, MPL, etc.
Example permissive licenses include the MIT, BSD (2 or 3 clause) and Apache.

If no copyright statement is included in the file, include one following the
form above, with the copyright line exactly as listed in the project's license,
and the full name of the license (e.g. "GNU LGPL 2.1", "BSD 3-clause") below.
Make sure to include the year if originally present; if not, include
the year(s) over which the original file was modified.

In the file's docstring, include the following lines at the end:

..code-block:: rest

  Adapted from path/to/file/in/repo.py of
  `ExampleProject <https://github.com/ExampleOrg/ExampleProject>`_.

Be sure to add all information in the template to NOTICE.txt in the repo root.

All files added should be normalized to UTF-8, LF line endings, an EOF newline,
HTTPS links (if available), no trailing spaces and ISO 8601 dates as required.

If substantial modifications are made or expected, conform to PEP 8 and PEP 257
as well at least one-line docstrings for each function, no pylint issues and
all other project standards and conventions.


When adding a directory (multiple files from a project):
========================================================

In addition to the above, add the project's LICENSE.txt in the directory, and
NOTICE.txt if present, and reference it in the header of each file (like here).

Add an __init__.py file and the header thereof if either not present,
and include the following in the docstring:

..code-block:: rest

  Objects defined in this module were adapted from the
  `ExampleProject <https://github.com/ExampleOrg/ExampleProject>`_.


When modifying an external file:
================================

If not already present, add another copyright line to the header of the form:

.. code-block:: none
    Copyright (c) <CURRENT YEAR>- Spyder Project Contributors

Also, note the file that were modified on the appropriate line in NOTICE.txt,
and very briefly the nature of the modification (bug fix, improvement, etc).


In case of any doubt, please examine the other files in this directory as
examples, and if still unsure please contact the Spyder team to inqiure.

Thanks!
