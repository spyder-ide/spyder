# Windows specific dependencies
channels:
  - conda-forge
dependencies:
  # This is a dummy dependency for Windows because it's also declared in
  # main.yml. But we have it here in case we need to add Windows-only deps
  # in the future (without this we'd have to remove code from CIs and tests
  # and restore it again if we were to have Windows-only deps again).
  - aiohttp >=3.9.3
