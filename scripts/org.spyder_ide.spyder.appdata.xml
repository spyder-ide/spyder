    <p>
      Spyder is a powerful scientific environment written in Python, for Python, and designed by and for
      scientists, engineers and data analysts.
      It features a unique combination of the advanced editing, analysis, debugging and profiling
      functionality of a comprehensive development tool with the data exploration, interactive execution,
      deep inspection and beautiful visualization capabilities of an analysis package.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, Spyder offers built-in integration with many popular scientific libraries, including NumPy,
      SciPy, Pandas, IPython, QtConsole, Matplotlib, SymPy, and more, and can be extended further with full
      plugin support. Spyder can also be used as a PyQt5 extension library, allowing you to build upon its
      functionality and embed its components, such as the interactive console, in your own software.
