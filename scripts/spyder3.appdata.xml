    <p>
      Spyder is a free open-source Python development environment providing MATLAB-like features in a simple and light-weighted software.
    </p>
    <p>
      It contains a powerful interactive development environment for the Python language with advanced editing, interactive testing, debugging and introspection features
      and a numerical computing environment thanks to the support of IPython (enhanced interactive Python interpreter) and popular Python libraries such as NumPy
      (linear algebra), SciPy (signal and image processing) or matplotlib (interactive 2D/3D plotting).
    </p>
    <p>
      Spyder may also be used as a library providing powerful console-related widgets for your PyQt-based applications – for example, it may be used to integrate
      a debugging console directly in the layout of your graphical user interface.
