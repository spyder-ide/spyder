Spyder: The Scientific Python Development Environment
#####################################################

*Spyder* is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for scientific computing, written in and for the Python programming language.
It comes with an :guilabel:`Editor` to write code, a :guilabel:`Console` to evaluate it and view the results at any time, a :guilabel:`Variable Explorer` to examine the variables defined during evaluation, and several other facilities to help you effectively develop the programs you need as a scientist.


This tutorial was originally authored by `Hans Fangohr <https://fangohr.github.io/>`__ from the University of Southampton (UK), and subsequently updated for Spyder 3.3.x by the development team (see `Historical note`_ for more details).



=======================
First steps with Spyder
=======================

This section is aimed at Python and Spyder beginners.
If you find it too simple, please continue to the `next one <python-beginners-ref_>`__.


Execute a given program
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We are going to run this program as a first example:

.. code-block:: python

    # Demo file for Spyder Tutorial
    # Hans Fangohr, University of Southampton, UK

    def hello():
        """Print "Hello World" and return None."""
        print("Hello World")

    # Main program starts here
    hello()

#. Please create a new file in the Spyder :guilabel:`Editor` pane (with :menuselection:`File --> New file`, or :kbd:`Ctrl-N`/ :kbd:`Command-N`).
   Then copy and paste the code inside the box above into the file, and save it with the name :file:`hello.py`.

#. To execute the program, select :menuselection:`Run --> Run` from the menu (or press :kbd:`F5`), and confirm the ``Run settings`` if required.

#. If this is your first time running something, you should see an output like this:

   .. code-block:: python

        In [1]: %runfile '/File/Path/hello.py' --wdir
        Hello World

        In [2]:

If so, then you have just run your first Python program -- well done.

.. note::

   The particular paths shown next to ``%runfile`` will depend on where you have saved the file, but this is inserted by Spyder automatically.


What happens when you execute a program?
----------------------------------------

#. Python reads the file line by line, ignoring comments (*i.e.* lines starting with the ``#`` symbol).

#. When it comes across the ``def`` keyword, it knows that a function is DEFined in this and the next (one or more) lines.
   All *indented* lines following ``def hello():`` belong to the function body.

   Note that the function object is created at this point in the file, but the function is not yet called (*i.e.* not executed).

#. When the Python interpreter encounters commands (other than ``def ...`` and a few other keywords) that are written in the left-most column, it will execute these immediately.

#. In the :file:`hello.py` file this is only the line reading ``hello()`` which will actually call (*i.e.* *execute*) the function with name ``hello``.

   If you comment or remove the line ``hello()`` from the program and run the whole file again (by pressing :kbd:`F5`, or selecting :menuselection:`Run --> Run`), nothing will be printed (because the function ``hello`` is defined but not called, *i.e.* not executed).

Now you should know how to execute a Python program that you have in the :guilabel:`Editor` pane in Spyder using the :guilabel:`IPython Console`.

If you are just starting to learn Python, this is probably a good point to return to your text book/course and look at further basic examples.

The next section gives more detailed information how you can execute *parts* of your code from the :guilabel:`Editor` in the :guilabel:`IPython Console`.
This is a more advanced technique but can be very useful.
You may also be interested in the option to execute "cells", `chunks of code that are separated by delimiters <cell-shortcut-ref_>`__.


Call existing functions in the Console
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _call-functions-console-ref:

Once you have executed the :file:`hello.py` program, the function object ``hello`` is defined and known to the :guilabel:`IPython Console`.
We can thus call the function from the :guilabel:`Console`.

Type ``hello()`` in the :guilabel:`Console` (next to ``In [?]`` prompt, where ``?`` is a count of the number of times you've executed something), and press the :kbd:`Enter` key.

You should find that the ``hello()`` function is executed again, *i.e.* printing ``Hello World`` a second time.
Your function call at the :guilabel:`Console` together with the output should look like this:

.. code-block:: python

    In [ ]: hello()
    Hello World

Can you see how this differs from executing the whole program again?

When we execute the whole program (by pressing :kbd:`F5`), Python goes through the file, creates the ``hello`` function object (overriding the previous object), reaches the ``hello()`` line and calls the function.

When we call ``hello()`` in the :guilabel:`Console`, we only call the function object ``hello`` that has been defined in the :guilabel:`IPython Console` when we executed the whole :file:`hello.py` file earlier (by pressing :kbd:`F5`).

This will become clearer over time, as we work with larger examples.
You may want to return to this tutorial at a slightly later stage.


Inspecting objects defined in the Console
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Python provides a function that displays all known objects in the current namespace of the :guilabel:`Console`, called ``dir``.
Type ``dir()`` at the prompt, and ignore everything starting with an underscore (``_``) for now.
Can you see ``hello`` in the list?

.. note::

   If you get a long list of defined objects, then Spyder may have done some convenience imports for you already.
   To address this you may want to `reset the namespace <reset-namespace-ref_>`_, execute :file:`hello.py` again by pressing :kbd:`F5`, then run ``dir()`` as suggested above.

Once an object is visible in the current namespace (as is ``hello`` in this example), we can use the ``help`` function as follows to learn about it.
Typing ``help(hello)`` at the :guilabel:`Console` prompt, you should see an output like this:

.. code-block:: python

    In [ ]: help(hello)
    Help on function hello in module __main__:

    hello()
        Print "Hello World" and return None.

Where does Python get that information from?
Some of it (like the number of input arguments and names of those variables; here we have none) Python can find through inspecting its objects.
Additional information comes from the documentation string provided for the function object ``hello``.
The documentation string, or *docstring*, is the first string immediately below the line ``def hello():``.
By convention, and as they usually extend over multiple lines, they are enclosed by triple double quotes (``"""``).

The Spyder environment also provides a :guilabel:`Help` pane which by default is located in the top right corner.

While the cursor is on the name of an object, press :kbd:`Ctrl-I` (or :kbd:`Command-I` on macOS), and you should find that the same information as we obtained from ``help(hello)`` is provided automatically in the :guilabel:`Help` pane:

.. image:: images/spyder-hello-docstring.png
   :align: center

This works in the :guilabel:`Console` and in the :guilabel:`Editor`.


Updating objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let's say you wanted to change how an existing function behaves -- how should you get Python to recognize your changes?


Simple strategy: Re-execute whole program
-----------------------------------------

#. In the :guilabel:`Editor` window, change the function ``hello`` so that it prints ``Good Bye World`` rather than ``Hello World``.

#. Press :kbd:`F5` (to execute the whole program)

#. Check that the output of the program is now:

   .. code-block:: python

        Good Bye World

What has happened when you pressed :kbd:`F5` is this: Python has gone through the :file:`hello.py` file and created a new function object ``hello`` (overriding the function object ``hello`` we had defined before) and then executed the function.


Looking at the details
----------------------

We'll now investigate this behavior in a little more depth:

#. We need to start with a clearly defined state.
   To do this, please change the function ``hello()`` back so that it prints ``Hello World``, then press :kbd:`F5` to run the whole program and check that it prints ``Hello World``.

#. Call the function ``hello()`` from the command prompt (as described `previously <call-functions-console-ref_>`__).
   You should see ``Hello World`` printed.

#. Now change the function definition so that it would print ``Later World``, and save the file (but do NOT execute the program, *i.e.* do NOT press :kbd:`F5` yet).

#. Call the function ``hello()`` in the :guilabel:`Console` again.
   You should find that the text printed reads ``Hello World``, like here:

   .. code-block:: python

        In [ ]: hello()
        Hello World

Why is this so?
Because the ``hello`` function object in the :guilabel:`Console` is the old one which prints ``Hello World``.
So far, we have changed the file :file:`hello.py` (and replaced ``Hello World`` in there with ``Later World``) in the :guilabel:`Editor` but this has not affected the objects that have previously been created in the :guilabel:`Console`.

To update the console's namespace with modified function, we have two options:

* Option 1: Execute the whole file :file:`hello.py` again by pressing :kbd:`F5`: this creates a new function object ``hello`` (and overrides the old one).
  You should find that if you press :kbd:`F5`, and then call ``hello()`` at the prompt, the new text ``Later World`` is printed.

* Option 2: Select the region you have changed (in this case the whole function ``hello``, starting from the line ``def hello():`` down to ``print("Later World")``, then click :menuselection:`Run --> Run selection or current line` or press :kbd:`F9`.

  This will update the ``hello`` object in the :guilabel:`Console` without having to execute the whole :file:`hello.py` file:

  .. code-block:: python

        In [ ]: def hello():
           ...:     """Print "Hello World" and return None."""
           ...:     print("Later world")
           ...:

  If we now type ``hello()``, we see the updated response:

  .. code-block:: python

        In [ ]: hello()
        Later world

The ability to execute *parts of the code* to update some objects in the :guilabel:`Console` (in the example above, we updated the function object ``hello``), is of great use when developing and debugging more complex programs, and when re-creating objects/data in the :guilabel:`Console` session takes time.
For example, by modifying only the functions (or classes/objects, etc). that we are actually developing or debugging, we can keep re-using the data and other objects created previously.



============================================
Recommended first steps for Python beginners
============================================

.. _python-beginners-ref:

Before we begin, make sure to have an :guilabel:`IPython Console` open (bottom-right by default).
This uses the `IPython <https://ipython.org>`__ interpreter, standard in the scientific community.
To open a new :guilabel:`Console` at any time, select :menuselection:`Consoles --> Open an IPython Console`.


Reset the namespace
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _reset-namespace-ref:

The `namespace <https://bytebaker.com/2008/07/30/python-namespaces/>`__ (*i.e.* the collection of objects defined in the :guilabel:`Console` at any given time) can be cleared in IPython using the ``%reset`` command.
Type ``%reset`` and press :kbd:`Enter`, then confirm with ``y``:

.. code-block:: none

    In [1]: %reset

    Once deleted, variables cannot be recovered. Proceed (y/[n])? y

    In [2]:

You can also accomplish the same thing by selecting ``Remove all variables`` from the "Gear" option menu in the top right of the :guilabel:`IPython Console` pane.
We discuss this a little further, but you can skip the following if you are not interested.

After issuing the ``%reset`` command or selecting ``Remove all variables``, we should only have a few objects defined in the namespace of that session.
We can list all of them using the ``dir()`` command:

.. code-block:: python

    In [2]: dir()
    Out[2]:
    ['In',
    'Out',
    '__builtin__',
    '__builtins__',
    '__name__',
    '_dh',
    '_i',
    '_i2',
    '_ih',
    '_ii',
    '_iii',
    '_oh',
    '_sh',
    'exit',
    'get_ipython',
    'quit']

Finally, if you like to skip the confirmation step of the ``reset`` command, you can use ``%reset -f`` instead of ``%reset``; or, tick the ``Don't show again`` checkbox in the ``Remove all variables`` dialog.


Strive for PEP8 Compliance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to the syntax that is enforced by the Python programming language, there are additional conventions regarding the layout of the source code, in particular the `Style Guide for Python source code <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`__ known as "PEP 8".
By following this guide and writing code in the same style as almost all Python programmers do, it becomes easier to read, and thus easier to debug and re-use -- both for the original author and others.

To have Spyder check this for you automatically, see the `next section <pep8-enable-ref_>`__.



====================
Selected preferences
====================

Where are the preferences?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A lot of Spyder's behaviour can be configured through its Preferences.
Where this is located in the menu depends on your operating system:

* On Windows and Linux, go to :menuselection:`Tools --> Preferences`

* On macOS, navigate to :menuselection:`Python/Spyder --> Preferences`


Warn if PEP 8 code style guidelines are violated
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _pep8-enable-ref:

Go to :menuselection:`Tools --> Preferences --> Completion and linting --> Code style and formatting --> Code style` and tick the checkbox next to ``Enable code style linting``.


Automatic Symbolic Python
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Through :menuselection:`Preferences --> IPython console --> Advanced Settings --> Use symbolic math` we can activate the console's SYMbolic PYthon (sympy) mode that is provided by the `SymPy <https://www.sympy.org/>`_ Python package.
This allows nicely rendered mathematical output (LaTeX style), imports some SymPy objects automatically when the :guilabel:`IPython Console` starts, and reports what it has done.
You'll need to have SymPy installed for it to work, and a LaTeX distribution on your system to see the formatted output (see the `Getting LaTeX <https://www.latex-project.org/get/>`__ page on the LaTeX site to acquire the latter, if you don't already have it).

.. code-block:: python

    These commands were executed:
    >>> from sympy import *
    >>> x, y, z, t = symbols('x y z t')
    >>> k, m, n = symbols('k m n', integer=True)
    >>> f, g, h = symbols('f g h', cls=Function)

We can now use the variables ``x`` and ``y``, for example like this:

.. image:: images/spyder-sympy-example.png
     :align: center



==============================
Shortcuts for useful functions
==============================

.. note::

   The following are the default shortcuts; however, those marked with ``*`` can be customized through the Keyboard shortcuts tab in the Preferences.
   Also, macOS users should substitute ``Command`` for ``Ctrl``, and ``Option`` for ``Alt``.

* :kbd:`F5`\* executes the current file.

* :kbd:`F9`\* executes the currently highlighted chunk of code; this is very useful to (say) update definitions of functions in the :guilabel:`Console` session without having to run the whole file again.
  If nothing is selected, :kbd:`F9`\* executes the current line.

* :kbd:`Tab`\* auto-completes commands, function names, variable names, and methods in the :guilabel:`Console` and the :guilabel:`Editor`.
  This feature is very useful, and should be employed routinely.
  Do try it now if auto-completion is new to you.
  Assume you have defined a variable::

    mylongvariablename = 42

  Suppose we need to write code that computes ``mylongvariablename + 100``.
  We can simply type ``my`` and then press the :kbd:`Tab` key.
  The full variable name will be completed and inserted at the cursor position if the name is unique, and then we can carry on and type `` + 100``.
  If the name is not uniquely identifiable given the letters ``my``, a list field will be displayed from which the desired variable can be chosen.
  Choosing from the list can be done with the :kbd:`Up` and :kbd:`Down` keys with the :kbd:`Enter` key to select, or by typing more letters of the name in question (the selection will update automatically) and confirming by pressing :kbd:`Enter` when the appropriate name is identified.

.. _cell-shortcut-ref:

* :kbd:`Ctrl-Enter`\* executes the current cell (menu entry :menuselection:`Run --> Run cell`).
  A cell is defined as the code between two lines which start with the characters ``#%%``, ``# %%`` or ``# <codecell>``.

* :kbd:`Shift-Enter`\* executes the current cell and advances the cursor to the next cell (menu entry :menuselection:`Run --> Run cell and advance`).

  Cells are useful for breaking large files or long blocks of code into more manageable chunks. Like those in an IPython notebook, each cell can be run independently.

* :kbd:`Alt-Up`\* moves the current line up.
  If multiple lines are highlighted, they are moved up together.
  :kbd:`Alt-Down`\* works correspondingly, moving line(s) down.

* :kbd:`Ctrl-LeftMouseButton` or :kbd:`Alt-G`\* on a function/method in the :guilabel:`Editor` opens a new :guilabel:`Editor` tab showing the definition of that function.

* :kbd:`Shift-Ctrl-Alt-M`\* maximizes the current window (or changes the size back to normal if pressed in a maximized window).

* :kbd:`Ctrl-Shift-F`\* activates the Find in Files pane, allowing ``grep``-like searches across all files in a specified scope.

* :kbd:`Ctrl - =` will increase the font size in the :guilabel:`Editor` or the :guilabel:`Console`, whereas :kbd:`Ctrl - -` will decrease it.

  The font face and size for other parts of the UI can be set under :menuselection:`Preferences --> General --> Appearance --> Fonts`.

* :kbd:`Ctrl-S`\* *in the* :guilabel:`Editor` saves the file currently being edited.
  This also forces various warning triangles in the left column of the :guilabel:`Editor` to be updated (otherwise they update every 2.5 seconds by default, which is also configurable).

.. _save-shortcut-console-ref:

* :kbd:`Ctrl-S`\* *in the* :guilabel:`Console` saves the current IPython session as an HTML file, including any figures that may be displayed inline.
  This is useful as a quick way of recording what has been done in a session.

  (It is not currently possible to load this saved record back into the session -- if you need functionality like this, look for the IPython Notebook).

* :kbd:`Ctrl-I`\* when pressed while the cursor is on an object opens documentation for that object in the help pane.



=================
Run configuration
=================

These are the settings that define how the file in the :guilabel:`Editor` is executed if we select :menuselection:`Run --> Run` or press :kbd:`F5`.

By default, the settings box will appear the first time we try to run a file.
If we want to change the settings at any other time, they can be found under :menuselection:`Run --> Configure` or by pressing :kbd:`F6`.

There are three choices for the :guilabel:`Console` to use, of which I'll discuss the first two.
Let's assume we have a program :file:`hello.py` in the :guilabel:`Editor` which reads

.. code-block:: python

    def hello(name):
        """Given an object 'name', print 'Hello ' and the object."""
        print("Hello {}".format(name))


    i = 42
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        hello(i)


Execute in current console
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is the default option, and generally a good choice.


Persistence of objects after code execution
-------------------------------------------

Choosing the ``Execute in current console`` setting under :menuselection:`Run --> Configure` means that:

* When the execution of :file:`hello.py` is completed, we can interact with the :guilabel:`Console` in which the program ran.

* In particular, we can inspect and interact with objects that the execution of our program created, such as ``i`` and ``hello()``.

This is generally very useful for incremental coding, testing and debugging.
For example, we can call ``hello()`` directly from the :guilabel:`Console` prompt, and don't need to execute the whole :file:`hello.py` for this (although if we change the function ``hello()``, we need to execute the file, or at least the function definition, to make the new version of ``hello()`` visible at the :guilabel:`Console`; either by re-executing the whole script or via :menuselection:`Run --> Run Selection`).


Persistence of objects from before code execution
-------------------------------------------------

However, executing the code in the :guilabel:`Editor` in the current :guilabel:`Console` also entails a third effect:

* The code that executes can see other (global) objects that were defined in the :guilabel:`Console` session.

*This* persistence of objects is easily forgotten and usually not required when working on small programs (although it can be of great value occasionally).
These objects could come from previous execution of code, from interactive work in the :guilabel:`Console`, or from convenience imports such as ``from sympy import *`` (Spyder may do some of those convenience imports automatically).

This visibility of objects in the :guilabel:`Console` namespace to the code we execute may also result in coding mistakes if the code inadvertently relies on these objects.

Here is an example: Imagine that:

#. We run the code :file:`hello.py`.
   Subsequently, the variable ``i`` is known in the :guilabel:`Console` as a global variable.

#. We edit the :file:`hello.py` source and accidentally delete the line ``i = 42``.

#. We execute the file containing :file:`hello.py` again.
   At this point, the call of ``hello(i)`` will *not* fail because the :guilabel:`Console` has an object of name ``i`` defined, although this is not defined in the source of :file:`hello.py`.

At this point, we could save :file:`hello.py` and (falsely) think it would execute correctly.
However, running it in a new :guilabel:`IPython Console` session (or via ``python hello.py`` in a system shell, say) would result in an error, because ``i`` is not defined.

The problem arises because the code makes use of an object (here ``i``) without creating it first.
This also affects importing of modules: if we had imported ``sympy`` at the IPython prompt, then our program will see that when executed in this :guilabel:`IPython Console` session.

To learn how we can double check that our code does not depend on such existing objects, see `below <check-code-independent-ref_>`_ .


Execute in a dedicated console
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Choosing ``Execute in a dedicated console`` under :menuselection:`Run --> Configure` will start *a new* :guilabel:`IPython Console` *every time* the :file:`hello.py` program is executed.
The major advantage of this mode over `Execute in current console`_ is that we can be certain that there are no global objects defined in this :guilabel:`Console` which originate from debugging and repeated execution of our code.
Every time we run the code in the :guilabel:`Editor`, the :guilabel:`IPython Console` in which the code runs is restarted.

This is a safe option, but provides less flexibility in interactive execution.


How to double check your code executes correctly "on its own"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _check-code-independent-ref:

Assuming you have selected the `Execute in current console`_ option, you have two methods to check that your code works on its own (*i.e.* it does not depend on undefined variables, unimported modules and commands etc):

* Switch from `Execute in current console`_ to `Execute in a dedicated console`_, and run the code from the :guilabel:`Editor`.

  Alternatively, if you want to stay with the current :guilabel:`Console`, you can

* First `reset the namespace <reset-namespace-ref_>`_ with IPython's magic ``%reset`` command or the ``Remove all variables`` menu option, which will clear all objects, such as ``i`` in the example above from the current namespace.
  Then, execute the code from the :guilabel:`Editor`.


Recommendation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

My recommendation for beginners would be to `Execute in current console`_.

Once you have completed a piece of code, double check that it executes independently using one of the options explained `above <check-code-independent-ref_>`_.



==================
Other observations
==================

Multiple files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When multiple files are opened in the :guilabel:`Editor`, the corresponding tabs at the top of the window area are arranged in the order they are opened, but can be easily moved around if you wish.

On the left of the tabs, there is as icon that shows ``Browse tabs`` if the mouse hovers over it.
It is useful to jump to a particular file directly, if many files are open.
You can also summon the file switcher through tapping ``Ctrl-Tab`` or ``Ctrl-P``, which navigates your tabs in most-recently-used order.


Environment variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Environment variables can be displayed from the IPython Console window (bottom right window in default layout).
Click on the ``Options`` menu ("Gear" icon), then select ``Show environment variables``.


Reset all customization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All customization saved on disk can be reset by calling Spyder from the command line with the switch ``--reset``, *i.e.* running ``spyder --reset``.


Objects in the Variable Explorer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Right-clicking on objects in the :guilabel:`Variable Explorer` displays options to plot and analyze these further.

Double-clicking on simple variables allows them to be edited directly, and double-clicking on objects opens a new window that displays their contents and often allows them to be edited.

Python collections (lists, dictionaries, tuples...), Numpy arrays, Pandas ``Index``, ``Series`` and ``DataFrame``, ``Pillow`` images and more can each be displayed and edited in specialized GUI viewers, and most arbitrary Python objects can be viewed, browsed and edited like their ``dict()`` representation.



===============================
Documentation string formatting
===============================

If you want to document the code you are developing (and you certainly should!), we recommend you write documentation strings (or *docstrings*) for it, using a special format called `reStructuredText (reST) <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html>`__.
In the scientific Python world, a further set of conventions called the `Numpydoc standard <https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html>`__ is typically followed (although other systems exist).
If you follow those guidelines, you can obtain beautifully formatted docstrings in Spyder.

For example, to get an ``average()`` function look like this in the Spyder :guilabel:`Help` pane:

.. image:: images/spyder-nice-docstring-rendering.png
     :align: center

you need to format the documentation string as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    def average(a, b):
        """
        Return the average value (arithmetic mean) of two numbers.

        Parameters
        ----------
        a : numeric
            A number to average.
        b : numeric
            Another number to average.

        Returns
        -------
        result : numeric
            The average of a and b, computed using ``0.5 * (a + b)``.

        Example
        -------
        >>> average(5, 10)
        7.5

        """

        return (a + b) * 0.5

What matters here is that the word ``Parameters`` is used, and underlined.
The line ``a : numeric`` shows us that the type of the parameter ``a`` is ``numeric``.
In the next line, which is indented, we can write a more extended explanation of what this variable represents, what conditions the allowed types have to fulfill, etc.

The same for all parameters, and also for the returned value.

Often it is a good idea to include an example too, as shown.



=========
Debugging
=========

Line by line step execution of code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Start debug execution (with the :menuselection:`Debug --> Debug` menu option or :kbd:`Ctrl-F5`) to activate the IPython debugger, ``ipdb``.
The :guilabel:`Editor` pane will then highlight the line that is about to be executed, and the :guilabel:`Variable Explorer` will display variables in the current context of the point of program execution.

After entering debug mode, you can execute the code line by line using the ``Step`` button of the :guilabel:`Debug` toolbar:

.. image:: images/debug-step-over.png
     :align: center

or the shortcut :kbd:`Ctrl-F10`.
You can also inspect how a particular function is working by stepping into it with the ``Step Into`` button

.. image:: images/debug-step-in.png
     :align: center

or the shortcut :kbd:`Ctrl-F11`.
Finally, to get out of a function and continue with the next line you need to use the ``Step Return`` button

.. image:: images/debug-step-out.png
     :align: center

or the shortcut :kbd:`Ctrl-Shift-F12`.

If you prefer to inspect your program at a specific point, you need to insert a
*breakpoint* by pressing :kbd:`F12` on the line on which you want to stop, or clicking to the right of the line number.
A red dot in this position indicates a breakpoint; it can be removed by repeating the same procedure.

After entering the Debugger, you can press the ``Continue`` button

.. image:: images/debug-continue.png
     :align: center

to stop the execution at the first breakpoint.

.. note::

   You can also control the debugging process by issuing these commands at the :guilabel:`Console` prompt:

   * ``n`` to move to the Next statement.

   * ``s`` to Step into the current statement. If this is a function call, step into that function.

   * ``r`` to complete all statements in the current function and return from that function before returning control.

Inside the debugger, you can also interactively execute many of the statements you can normally, including assigning and modifying variables, defining and calling functions, setting new breakpoints, and more.

For example, enter the following code into a new or temporary file::

   def demo(x):
       for i in range(5):
           print("i = {}, x = {}".format(i, x))
           x = x + 1

   demo(0)

If we execute this (:menuselection:`Run --> Run`), we should see the output:

.. code-block:: python

	i = 0, x = 0
	i = 1, x = 1
	i = 2, x = 2
	i = 3, x = 3
	i = 4, x = 4

Now run this using the debugger (:menuselection:`Debug --> Debug`), press the ``Step`` button until the highlighted line reaches the ``demo(0)`` function call, then press the ``Step into`` to inspect this function.
Keep pressing the ``Step`` button to execute the next lines.
Then, modify ``x`` by typing ``x = 10`` in the debugger prompt.
You should see ``x`` changing in the :guilabel:`Variable Explorer` and when its value is printed as part of the ``demo()`` function.
(The printed output appears between your debugger commands and responses).

This debugging ability to execute code line by line, to inspect variables as they change, and to modify them manually is a powerful tool to understand what a piece of code is doing (and to correct it if desired).

To terminate the debugger, you can type ``exit``, select :menuselection:`Debug --> Stop` or press :kbd:`Ctrl-Shift-F12`.


Debugging once an exception has occurred in the Console
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the :guilabel:`IPython Console`, we can call ``%debug`` straight after an exception has been raised: this will start the IPython debug mode, which allows inspection of local variables at the point where the exception occurred as described above.
This is a lot more efficient than adding ``print`` statements to the code an running it again.

If you use this, you may also want to use the commands ``up`` (*i.e.* press ``u`` at the debugger) and ``down`` (*i.e.* press ``d``) which navigate the inspection point up and down the stack.
(Up the stack means to the functions that have called the current function; down is the opposite direction).
You can also enable (or disable) this debugger being triggered automatically when an exception occurs by typing ``pdb`` at any time.



========
Plotting
========

You can decide whether figures created with Matplotlib will show

* *Inline*, *i.e.* inside the :guilabel:`IPython Console`, or

* Inside a *new window*, with an options toolbar.

The first option is convenient to save a record of the interactive session (:kbd:`Ctrl-S` `in the console <save-shortcut-console-ref_>`_).

The second option allows you to interactively zoom into the figure, manipulate it, set various plot and display options, and save it to different file formats via a menu.

The command to get the figures to appear *inline* in the :guilabel:`IPython Console` is:

.. code-block:: python

    In [ ]: %matplotlib inline

The command to get figures appear in their own window (rendered by the Qt backend) is:

.. code-block:: python

    In [ ]: %matplotlib qt

The Spyder preferences can be used to customize the default behavior, under  :menuselection:`Preferences --> IPython Console --> Graphics --> Graphics Backend`.

Here are two lines you can use to quickly create a plot and test this:

.. code-block:: python

    In [ ]: import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    In [ ]: plt.plot(range(10), 'o')
